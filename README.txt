Motivation & Disclaimer:

this is a PHP 8.0+ playground for me. It is not intended to be used
without thinking in PROD systems.

Playground to me means:


Intention
- learning about formerly unknown/lesser known PHP features
- doing performance  profiling
- testing non- or even unusual design and architecture stuff

- well tested parts COULD be taken into other of projects of mine (P7Tools etc. )

- binary arithmetic

 --> Bit as Object?? Bitwise operations will be done with PHPs binary OPs,
 but we want to have an OOP-wise API access to bits, nibbles, bytes etc..
